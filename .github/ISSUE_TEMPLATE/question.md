Before asking, check closed issues to see if someone else has already solved your problem. 

We follow the Stack-Overflow ways of asking and responding to questions. Before you pose your question, read [this](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

Also, make sure you skim through the questions and see if you can solve their problem. 


Finally, when someone has given you an acceptable answer, close the issue. (Developers may also close issues)
