    "# Course Overview\n",
    "This tutorial provides an introduction to working with Earth Observation (EO) data, focusing on using advanced geospatial tools and datacube structures to analyze satellite imagery. Youâ€™ll learn how to manage complex geometries, perform image differencing, and apply vegetation indices like NDVI to understand environmental changes. The course also covers how to manipulate spatial filters and masks for enhanced analysis, as well as techniques for visualizing EO data.\n",

    "- **Pixel Analysis**: Calculate areas and assess the validity of pixel data (e.g., cloud cover or land type) within defined regions, essential for accurate environmental monitoring and change detection.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Data Visualization**: Visualize and interpret Sentinel-2 satellite imagery by creating true-color (RGB) and NIR-GB images, useful for assessing vegetation health and land cover changes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Change Detection**: Use temporal or spectral analysis to detect and quantify differences between satellite images captured at different times, crucial for tracking environmental changes like deforestation or urbanization.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Advanced Data Processing**: Apply advanced EO metrics such as NDVI and perform band math using Python operators to extract meaningful insights from satellite data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Masking and Spatial Filtering**: Use masking techniques to filter out unwanted data (e.g., clouds) and apply spatial filtering to enhance image features, such as smoothing noise or detecting edges.\n"
