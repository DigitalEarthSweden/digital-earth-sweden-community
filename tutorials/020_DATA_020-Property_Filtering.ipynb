    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In satellite data processing, filtering based on specific properties can be used for refining datasets to meet particular analysis requirements. Whether you're interested in filtering data by cloud cover, spatial extent, or temporal range, understanding how to apply these filters effectively within the `load_collection` process is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates examples of applying property filtering using the OpenEO API. By leveraging property filters, you can fine-tune the data you work with, ensuring that only the most relevant datasets are used in your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this tutorial is to show how to apply property filtering in the `load_collection` process using the OpenEO API. We will cover various property filters, including numerical ranges and conditional statements, allowing for precise control over the data retrieval process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will explore the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding Property Filters**: Learn about the different properties available for filtering satellite data, such as cloud cover, spatial extent, and temporal range.\n",
    "2. **Applying Simple Filters**: Use basic filtering techniques to narrow down datasets based on specific property criteria.\n",
    "3. **Combining Filters for Complex Queries**: Combine multiple filters to create complex queries that refine datasets based on a combination of conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let's Begin\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by importing the necessary Python modules and establishing a connection to the OpenEO backend. Then, we'll proceed with applying property filters to fetch and analyze the relevant satellite imagery data.\n",

    "### Understanding Property Filtering in Satellite Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with satellite data, it's essential to understand that the data is divided both spatially and temporally. The data is segmented into **granules** (which may be, for example, 100km a side depending on the collection), each covering specific portions of the Earth's surface. Additionally, each granule is associated with specific acquisition times, as satellites capture data in discrete passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when analyzing an area in Sweden, your area of interest (AOI) may intersect multiple granules, each captured at different times and under varying conditions such as cloud cover. These granules have their own set of properties, including spatial attributes like `cloud_cover` and temporal attributes like `datetime`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Property and Temporal Filtering Works\n",
    "\n",
    "When you specify a time range (e.g., \"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z\" to \"2023-07-31T00:00:00Z\"), OpenEO will consider only granules that overlap with your area of interest and fall within your specified temporal range.\n",
    "\n",
    "After spatial and temporal filtering, OpenEO further evaluates each remaining granule against your property filters, such as `cloud_cover < 20%`. If, for example, your AOI intersects three granules within the time range, but only two meet the cloud cover criteria, only those two granules will be used in the data returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to analyze vegetation in an area over the summer months from 2020 to 2023 with minimal cloud interference. You might set a temporal filter for June through August of each year and a cloud cover filter of less than 20%. OpenEO will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Select Granules**: Identify all granules that cover your AOI and were captured within your specified summer months.\n",
    "2. **Apply Cloud Cover Filter**: Further filter these granules to include only those with less than 20% cloud cover.\n",
    "3. **Stitch Data**: Combine the relevant parts of granules that match both the time and spatial criteria to \"cover\" the area of interest with data.\n",
    "4. **Return Data**: Provide the final dataset, which includes only the portions of your AOI covered by the granules that met both the temporal and property filter criteria.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll focus on a very small area (approximately 10x10 pixels at 10m resolution) within Sweden. This area is deliberately small, so the number of resulting files should be manageable even if we receive multiple data granules.  Since we're not applying a strict filter on cloud cover or other properties (using a relatively high threshold for cloud cover), we'll likely retrieve all available granules that match our spatial and temporal extent. Since there is a limit how many files you can download by default, we can safely increase that limit since each image will be very small. This is done with the `max_files` parameter in the `download` function. It specifies the maximum number of files to download. By setting `max_files` to 30, we're ensuring that we can get enough files to see the difference when applying the property filter and we do not risk that the number of files becomes overwhelming, even if many granules match our criteria.\n",
