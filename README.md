# Digital-Earth-Sweden Community

This is where you can:
- File bug reports
- Make wishes for and discuss new features
- Ask and answer questions

The community repo is shared and monitored by developers, stakeholders and regular users. It is the resposibility for us all to look into this repository and help each other out. 


**NOTE!** We are primarily using the "issues" (top left corner).
